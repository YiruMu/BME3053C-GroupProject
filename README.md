# Cough Signal Based COVID Detection

## Introduction
The broad scope of our project is to use machine learning to be able to detect within a range of accuracy whether or not an individual has been infected with COVID-19. Our project is based around the variations of signal frequencies in cough recordings between healthy and COVID-19 patients. We are achieving this through the utilization of decision tree model, KNN model, SVM model and a 2-layer neural network to train a model that can be used to predict potential COVID-19 patients based on signal variations of their coughs.  Our aim is to offer an easily accessible COVID-19 test based on signal frequencies of a cough.
